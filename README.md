# SMuFL Viewer

This project for inspecting the glyphs and metadata of the [SMuFL Standard](https://www.smufl.org/) and fonts.

The SMuFL website used to have a glyph inspector showing details like the baseline, bounding box, anchor points etc. as included in the
`metadata.json` file. This app aims to bring back a glyph viewer with exactly this functionality. 

## Features

* Browse the glyphs defined in the SMuFL Standard
* Search and Filter for glyphs
* Switch between a variety of SMuFL compliant fonts.
    * Check for the font completeness
* Render glyphs with their details like origin, anchors, bounding boxes etc.
